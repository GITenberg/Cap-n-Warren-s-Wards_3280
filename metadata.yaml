description: Cap'n Warren's Wards is the first book by Joseph C. Lincoln that moves
  off the fictional towns of Cape Cod (in this case South Denboro) and into the big
  city hustle of Manhattan. Elijah Warren finds himself the guardian of his brother's
  children who are rapidly reaching adulthood but haven't had to face the harsh realities
  of self responsibility due to their father's wealth. Unfortunately now there are
  a few snags with A. Rodgers Warren's estate and Cap'n Warren decides its best to
  toughen his wards up and maybe teach them some humility in the process. Returning
  to his native Cape Cod village after many years of living at sea, Cy Whittaker finds
  the old homestead no longer the place of his boyhood. So-called "improvements" have
  been going on in his absence, and he finds it  all sadly changed. The old man adopts
  the little daughter of a worthless drunkard, with the intent of giving the child
  an education. A Congressman from the district, years before, had appropriated property
  belonging to the child, and he, together with the father, fights to regain possession
  of the child. The sympathy of the village goes out to the father, but Cy Whittaker
  and Phoebe Dawes, the school teacher, manage to outwit the Congressman and the drunken
  father, and in the end the old bachelor and the school mistress fall in love with
  each other.
